#Relational Operators with Strings:
v = 'Hello'
a = 'Bye'
c = 'Hello'
x = 'Die'
m = 'Helloo'
r1 = c == a
r2 = c != a
r3 = c == v
r4 = a == x
r5 = m >= v
print (r1)
print (r2)
print (r3)
print (r4)
#The size of the 'm' string is bigger than the size of the 'v' string.
#The content had  an extra valuable point to Python.
print (r5)
#Each

b = 'Hola'
y = 'xwz'
g = y >= b
print (g)
